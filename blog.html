								<h2>Crumbs</h2>
								<p>April 21st, 2024</p>
							</header>
							<p>
In the garden of my heart, you planted seeds of hope,</br>
Promises whispered, like secrets in the dark, you spoke.</br>
You led me on a dance, a waltz of false affection,</br>
Each step we took together, fueled my deep connection.</br>
<!-- Your whispers, like echoes, resonated with affection,</br> -->
But behind your words lay an avoidant's reflection.</br></p>

<p>
Your breadcrumbs led me on a journey of delusion,</br>
A maze of false hope, a twisted, cruel illusion.</br>
But your moves were calculated, a choreographed deceit,</br>
Leaving me tangled in your web of incomplete.</br></p>

<p>I watered those seeds with tears of devotion,</br>
But you, like a drought, withheld your emotion.</br>
Your avoidance a shield, protecting your heart's core,</br>
Leaving me stranded, longing for more.</br></p>

<p>I built castles in the air, with bricks of expectation,</br>
Dreaming of a future, built on our foundation.</br>
But you were but a ghost, haunting my desires,</br>
Leaving me stranded amidst my burning fires.</br></p>

<p>I'm tired of your games, your manipulative art,</br>
Of being the puppet, dancing to your heart.</br>
You played the role of lover, but commitment you refused,</br>
Leaving me with scars, deep and bruised.</br></p>

<p>So now I stand here, weary and worn,</br>
A heart once tender, now battered and torn.</br>
I release you from my grasp, set you free to roam,</br>
For I deserve a love thatâ€™s real, a love that calls me home.</br></p>

<p>I stand tall, resilient, in the face of your allure,</br>
For I know my worth, my heart pure and sure.</br>
No longer entangled in your web of deceit,</br>
I walk away, whole again, in my own beat.</br>

<p>I am not your toy, not your game to play,</br>
I am a force of nature, finding my own way.</br>
And though you may linger, in the shadows, still,</br>
I have found my light, my strength, my will.</br>

								<h2>What is a stack?</h2>
								<p>April 19th, 2024</p>
							</header>
							<p>A stack is a collection of elements that can only be accessed from the beginning or end of the collection. Picture a stack of pancakes, where you can either add a pancake (push), or take a pancake (pop). This method of accessing elements is called LIFO, and stands for Last In, First Out.</p>
							<img src="./images/Lifo_stack.svg" alt="diagram visualizing the concept of LIFO, adding and removing elements from a stack.">
							<p>A stack is an abstract and linear data type. Abstract data type (ADT) means you don't need to know how the data type keeps track of the elements. In these cases, the inner workings are <strong>abstracted</strong> from your knowledge. This is the same across different languages when it comes to ADT. Whether you use arrays in JavaScript or lists in C#, they both store elements and have methods that you can use to access them.</p>

								<h2>Lyrid Meteor Shower</h2>
								<p>April 18th, 2024</p>
							</header>
							<p>Named for the nearby constellation Lyra, the Lyrid meteor shower is composed of pieces of debris from the Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher. A.E. Thatcher was an amateur astronomer living in New York when he discovered the comet in 1861. The meteor shower itself has been observed for 2,700 years ever since the first recorded sighting was made by the Chinese in 687 BC. </p>
							<p>This year, the peak of this meteor shower falls on April 21-22. If you are in the northern hemisphere and want to catch it, head away from the city lights and find a section of dark skies. The best visibility will be after moonset and before dawn. Lie flat on your back with your feet facing East and looking up. Wait for your eyes to adjust to the dark (30 minutes) and you should begin to see meteors.</p>
